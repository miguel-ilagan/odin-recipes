        <h2>Description</h2>
        Homemade potato chips are fun and easy. Guaranteed they won't last long! 
        A food processor with a slicing attachment is very helpful for slicing the potatoes. 
        Experiment with the thickness; you may like them thicker or thinner. 
        I like to use olive oil for frying, but you can use safflower, corn, or peanut oil as well as vegetable oil.
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 medium potatoes, peeled and sliced paper-thin</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons salt, plus more to taste</li>
            <li>1 quart oil for deep frying</li>

        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
            <li>Transfer potato slices to a large bowl of cold water as you slice them.</li>
            <li>
                Drain slices and rinse under cold water. 
                Refill the bowl with water, add 3 tablespoons salt, and put slices back in the bowl. 
                Let potatoes soak in the salty water for at least 30 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>Drain and rinse slices again. Pat dry.</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a deep-fryer to 365 degrees F (185 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Working in small batches, fry potato slices until golden. 
                Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels. 
                Continue until all of the slices are fried.
            </li>
            <li>Season potato chips with additional salt if desired.</li>
            <li>Serve and enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
